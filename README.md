My product can loosely be described to be a streaming music player that is controlled using hand motions/gestures. The product makes use of a raspberry pi that is set up as a server that streams music from different sources(for example spotify) or plays music stored locally in the pi. Once a playlist is loaded on the server, you can then use your hand to execute commands normally associated with music players; changing volume level, pause/play and next. You execute play/pause by putting your hand anywhere between 1 to 5 cm from the pi. You select the next track by placing your hand about 7­12 cm away from the pi. You change the volume level by placing your hand between 15 ­ 35 cm away from the pi. As you move your hand further or closer in this range you will notice the respective change in volume. 35cm is max volume and 0 cm is mute. I added an led that lets you know when a song is currently playing. The brightness of the LED also changes with volume. The LED also serves to help you know where to place your hand.
